1-Declare a variable x and initialize it with an integer.

2-How do you round the number 7.25, to the nearest integer?

3-Create a array called colors with the strings red, green and blue inside.

4-How can you find the length of the string you just created?

5-Write a program that checks the types of two variables and prints out SAME TYPE if they are the same type. For example:

let x = 9;
let y = 'Hello';

if () {
  console.log('SAME TYPE');
}
6-If x equals 7, and the only other statement is x = x % 3, what would be the new value of x?

7-Write a program to answer the following questions:

Can you store multiple types in an array? Numbers and strings?
Can you compare inifities? (Not in Eyad's world) - does 6/0 == 10/0? How can you test this?
